       <h1>ReactJs</h1>
    <p>FrontEnd Development tool for creating single page application</p>
    <p>React, also known as ReactJS, is a well-known front-end JavaScript library for developing user interfaces and related components. It employs the MVC architecture, with a different table of presentation and data availability. One of its distinguishing features is the Virtual DOM and how it handles document access and manipulation. The DOM interacts well with HTML and XML documents, causing them to behave similarly to a tree structure, and each HTML element functions as an object. </p>
    <p> React, which is powered by Facebook, has been recognized as a fantastic library in the front-end family of tools. It uses the JSX coding style, with a mix of HTML quotes and tag syntax, to create the components. It breaks down larger components into smaller ones that can be managed separately and individually. With this feature, developers' overall productivity is bound to rise. Developers can check out various React Admin Template available in the market to accelerate their development process and create professional and visually appealing admin interfaces. </p>
