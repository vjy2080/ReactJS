            <li> <strong>FrontEnd Development tool for creating single page application</strong></li>
            <li> React, also known as ReactJS, is a well-known front-end JavaScript library for developing user interfaces and related components.</li>
            <li> It employs the MVC architecture, with a different table of presentation and data availability.</li>
            <li> One of its distinguishing features is the Virtual DOM and how it handles document access and manipulation.</li>
            <li> The DOM interacts well with HTML and XML documents, causing them to behave similarly to a tree structure, and each HTML element functions as an object. </li>
            <li> React, which is powered by Facebook, has been recognized as a fantastic library in the front-end family of tools.</li>
            <li> It uses the JSX coding style, with a mix of HTML quotes and tag syntax, to create the components.</li>
            <li> It breaks down larger components into smaller ones that can be managed separately and individually.</li>
            <li> With this feature, developers' overall productivity is bound to rise.</li>
            <li> Developers can check out various React Admin Template available in the market to accelerate their development process and create professional and visually appealing admin interfaces. </li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Pros: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Component reusability facilitates collaboration and reuse in other parts of the application.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Through the use of&nbsp;virtual DOM, you can achieve consistent and seamless performance.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>It is the ultimate solution to writing components in React hooks because it allows you to write components without classes and makes learning React easier.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>React dev tools are advanced and extremely useful.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Due to this frontend framework's multiple and constant updates, it is hard to create proper documentation, which has an effect on the learning curve for beginners.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>When starting out with the framework, developers find it difficult to understand the complexities of JSX.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>It only provides solutions for the front end.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
